1. Overview:
Stream analytics on real-time events has an insatiable demand for throughput and latency. Its performance on a single machine is central to meeting this demand, even in a distributed system. StreamBox is a novel stream processing engine that:
 * Exploits the parallelism and memory hierarchies in modern multicore hardware.
 * Supports out-of-order data processing.
 * Scales to a large number of cores.
 * Achieves throughput on-par with distributed engines on medium-size clusters. 
 * Delivers latencies in the tens of milliseconds, which are 20Ã— shorter than other large-scale streaming engines.
 * Follows the Google dataflow (Apache Beam) programming model.
