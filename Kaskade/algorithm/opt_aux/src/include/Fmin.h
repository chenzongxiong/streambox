  \brief 
  This function performs a uni-dimensional minimization by Brent's method.
  
  Brent's method combines a golden-section search and parabolic interpolation.  
  The following introductory comments are copied from the FORTRAN version.
  
  Convergence is never much slower than that for a Fibonacci search.  If f 
  has a continuous second derivative which is positive at the minimum (which 
  is not at ax or bx), then convergence is superlinear, and usually of the 
  order of about 1.324.
  
  The function f is never evaluated at two points closer together
  than eps*abs(fmin)+(tol/3), where eps is approximately the square
  root of the relative machine precision.  If f is a unimodal
  function and the computed values of f are always unimodal when
  separated by at least eps*abs(x)+(tol/3), then fmin approximates
  the abcissa of the global minimum of f on the interval (ax,bx) with
  an error less than 3*eps*abs(fmin)+tol.  If f is not unimodal,
  then fmin may approximate a local, but perhaps non-global, minimum to
  the same accuracy.
  
  This function subprogram is a slightly modified version of the
  Algol 60 procedure localmin given in Richard Brent, Algorithms For
  Minimization Without Derivatives, Prentice-Hall, Inc. (1973).
  
   This method is a translation from FORTRAN to Java of the Netlib 
   function fmin.  In the Netlib listing no author is given.
